# Outstanding Issues
    * Convert to Typescript
    * Not updating state/rendering when adding new widget
    * HTML input for datetime storing as UTC is deprecated.  Now only stores local date/time without the time zone.

# Features to implement
    * Rich text field
    * Proper readme with instructions on starting the app
