# Outstanding Issues
    * Convert to Typescript
    * Not updating state/rendering when adding new widget.  Need callback function to update state to make this happen.
    * HTML input for datetime storing as UTC is deprecated.  Now only stores local date/time without the time zone.

# Features to implement
    * Server-side data to pass "types" to client to render options in form
